# ‚ñ∂ pipewire-gin

While plumbing @pipewire on #fedora I discovered this cool #gnome-shell extension [argos](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1176/argos/) and distilled some gin.

First devil's drops of pipewire-gin extension of argos extension of gnome extension of my desktop extension of life extension üçæ

- The best thing about it - very easy to customise üèÜ
- It is possible to make it static and update content on "open", etc
- Current version could be usefull for developers, it will refresh hw_params of selected /proc/asound playback device every 1s or whatever it is set to, to 'real-time' monitor format and sample rate
- Could this provide easy acces to chaging default params "on the go"?
- Not quite sure yet howto pw-cli set-param to node 0 to change default.clock.rate = "48000" and default.clock.allowed-rates = "[ 48000 ]", (frames, buffers etc)
